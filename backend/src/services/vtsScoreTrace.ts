/**
 * VTS Score Trace — internal operator explainability only.
 *
 * Builds a ScoreTrace from stored generated_profile_reports data.
 *
 * Category contributions come from scoreByCategory / risk columns.
 * Per-factor detail uses stored factorExplanations, or is rebuilt from
 * formula_detail by getVtsScoreTrace when that field was never persisted.
 *
 * This trace operates at the CATEGORY level:
 * - Product risk contribution  = ProductRisk × 0.40
 * - Governance risk contribution = GovernanceRisk × 0.30
 * - Operational risk contribution = OperationalRisk × 0.30
 *
 * Each category's contribution to the final VTS is emitted as a component.
 * Per-factor detail (cert-level, policy-level) comes from stored factorExplanations
 * or is rebuilt from formula_detail by getVtsScoreTrace when missing.
 *
 * INTERNAL USE ONLY — never return this data to buyer or vendor users.
